# Global Terrorism Analysis Dashboard üåç

An interactive data visualization project exploring global terrorism patterns through multiple visualization libraries including D3.js, Plotly, and Bokeh. This project provides comprehensive insights into terrorism incidents worldwide through various interactive visualizations.

## üìä Features

### 1. Global Terrorism Heatmap (D3.js)
- Interactive world map showing terrorism incidents by country
- Dynamic year-based filtering through a slider
- Color-coded choropleth visualization
- Hover tooltips with detailed country statistics
- Responsive legend showing incident density

### 2. Top 10 Terrorist Groups Analysis (D3.js)
- Dynamic horizontal bar chart visualization
- Year-based filtering through dropdown menu
- Smooth animations for data transitions
- Interactive hover effects
- Color scaling based on incident counts
- Total incident count display for selected year

### 3. Attack Types Temporal Analysis (Plotly)
- Stacked area chart showing attack type distribution over time
- Toggle between different views:
  - Stacked
  - Grouped
  - 100% Stacked
- Interactive hover information
- Detailed legend for attack types

### 4. Target Types and Casualties Analysis (Bokeh)
- Interactive scatter plot visualization
- X-axis: Number of fatalities
- Y-axis: Number of wounded
- Point size indicates total casualties
- Color-coded by target type
- Year range slider for temporal filtering
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
